# 🎲 Dice Game – Fundamental Revision Project

---

## 📌 Overview

This Dice Game application is a frontend-focused practice project developed to reinforce and revise core React fundamentals and essential JavaScript concepts.

The objective of this project is not feature complexity, but clarity of logic, predictable state transitions, clean UI composition, and structured component architecture.

It is intentionally built without any backend integration to maintain focus on front-end engineering fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was developed as:

* 🧠 A revision exercise for core React concepts
* ⚛️ A practical implementation of state-driven UI rendering
* 🧩 A demonstration of component-based architecture
* 📱 A responsive UI design practice project
* 🧪 A logic validation exercise using deterministic conditions

The emphasis is placed on correctness, readability, and structured implementation rather than feature expansion.

---

## 🚀 Application Logic

The gameplay follows a minimal and deterministic structure:

* The user selects a number between 1 and 6
* The dice is rolled
* If the rolled number matches the selected number:

  * The user wins the round
* If the rolled number does not match:

  * The user loses the round
* The score can be reset at any time
* Rules can be toggled dynamically

The logic is fully controlled using React state management and conditional rendering.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend Framework:** React (Functional Components)
* **State Management:** useState / useReducer
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Flexbox, Responsive Layout, Modern UI Patterns)
* **Architecture Approach:** Component-Based Design
* **Backend:** ❌ None (Frontend-Only Implementation)

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Reinforced

* Declarative UI Design
* Controlled State Management
* Conditional Rendering
* Event Handling
* Component Reusability
* Responsive Layout Engineering
* Clean Separation of Concerns

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:

* Desktop Screens
* Tablets
* Mobile Devices

Modern layout techniques ensure consistency across varying screen sizes.
