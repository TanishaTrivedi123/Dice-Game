🎲 Dice Game – Fundamental Revision Project 📌 Overview

This Dice Game application is a frontend-focused practice project developed to reinforce and revise core React fundamentals and essential JavaScript concepts.

The objective of this project was not feature complexity, but clarity of logic, predictable state transitions, clean UI composition, and structured component architecture.

It is intentionally built without any backend integration to maintain focus on front-end engineering fundamentals.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was developed as:

🧠 A revision exercise for core React concepts

⚛️ A practical implementation of state-driven UI rendering

🧩 A demonstration of component-based architecture

📱 A responsive UI design practice project

🧪 A logic validation exercise using deterministic conditions

The emphasis was placed on correctness, readability, and structured implementation rather than feature expansion.

🚀 Application Logic

The gameplay follows a minimal and deterministic structure:

The user selects a number between 1 and 6.

The dice is rolled.

If the rolled number matches the selected number:

The user wins the round.

If the rolled number does not match:

The user loses the round.

The score can be reset at any time.

Rules can be toggled dynamically.

The logic is fully controlled using React state management and conditional rendering.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend Framework: React (Functional Components)

State Management: useState / useReducer

Styling: CSS3 (Flexbox, Responsive Layout, Modern UI Patterns)

Architecture Approach: Component-Based Design

Backend: ❌ None (Frontend-Only Implementation)

🧠 Core Concepts Reinforced

Declarative UI Design

Controlled State Management

Conditional Rendering

Event Handling

Component Reusability

Responsive Layout Engineering

Clean Separation of Concerns

📱 Responsiveness

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:
